 * One JSON file per top-level declaration.

 * headers, and names its neighbours by bare identifier. Cut one out and the
 * result either fails to compile or — worse — compiles into a different type
 * in a different package. See readme.md.
 *
 * The parsed JSON has no such problem. It is a description of a declaration,
 * not a translation unit, so a single declaration extracted from it is exactly
 * as true as the whole.
