/**
 * Unbundling: one descriptor becomes a tree of files, one per declaration.
 *
 * A protobuf descriptor has no `$ref`, so the pieces cannot point at each
 * other the way the JSON Schema packages' do. Each piece is instead a namespace
 * document carrying one declaration inside the packages it is declared in, and
 * the root document records where each declaration went.
 *
 * A piece is read with `root.addJSON(piece.nested)`, not `Root.fromJSON`: that
 * one resolves as it loads, and a declaration naming a type that lives in
 * another piece has nothing to resolve against until the tree is back
 * together. Adding every piece to one root reconstitutes the bundle exactly.
 * See readme.md.
